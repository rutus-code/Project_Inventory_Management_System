Hello Professor, 
In this project I am implementing inventory Management System using following data structures. 
1. Hash Table
2. AVL Tree
3. Heap Priority Queue
4. Linked list
5. Trie for searching product by name or category.

This is the part 1 deliverable where i have implemented the codes for the above mentioned data structure and a brief summary of how IMS works to capture the data dynamically.
